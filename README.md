# MLflow Example Project

This repository contains example code for using **MLflow** to track, manage, and (optionally) serve machine learning experiments and models in Python.

MLflow is an open-source platform for **experiment tracking, model versioning, and reproducible workflows**. It lets you log parameters, metrics, artifacts, and models, and later compare experiments using a UI. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
